	Therefore, if Coefficients has the elements [m,n,o,p], Divisor has
	the value 'x' and StartValue is 'A' then the ladder product is
	defined as follows:
	
	  | m n o p

	V = o + C
	D = x*V = x*(o + C)
	LastTerm = W = p + D
	NewCoefficients = [T,U,V]
	
	For the case of Ruffini's rule:
	-> Coefficients must be a list of integer values with a '1' in the
	first element.
	-> StartValue (A) has to be 0
	-> Divisor must divide the last element of Coefficients
	-> NewCoefficients are the integer values representing the coefficients
	of a new polynomial.
	-> LastTerm must be equal to 0 for Divisor to be a root of the
	polynomial represented by Coefficients.
